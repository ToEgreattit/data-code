# data-code

Code and data to estimate the time of emergence across levels of biological organization in great tits.

## File description

* "code MS ToE_greattit.R" 

Code for running the analysis in R.
Running requires additional data files (see below).

* "dd_red_red.txt" 

Beech crop index (BCI) from 1985 to 2019 in the studied great tit population. Three levels are considered (1, 2 and 3).

* "mismatchok.txt" 

Mismatch between laying dates and food peaks from 1985 to 2019 in the studied great tit population. 

* "TempWindows.RCP8.5.GreatTit.txt"

Expected spring temperatures according to the RCP 8.5 climate scenario, during the time windows 11 March - 20 April that influences laying dates.

* "TempWindows.RCP8.5.WinterMoth.txt"

Expected spring temperatures according to the RCP 8.5 climate scenario, during the time windows 6 March - 14 May that influences caterpillar peaks.

* "output_IPM.txt"

Annual age-specific population size and vital rates (survival and recruitment) estimated with an integrated population model (IPM, see Gamelon et al. 2016 Ecology for a full description and the code) between 1985 and 2020 in the studied great tit population.
